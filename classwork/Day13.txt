Union:
Only one member of the union can only access at a time.
It takes the size of the union of the large size of the data type
Union item{
       Int m;
      Float x;
     Char c;
};
Here the size of the float(4 bytes) is more than the other members in the union so,the size of union is 4 bytes
Program
// Online C compiler to run C program online
#include <stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<string.h>
typedef struct employee{
   int id;
   float sal;
   char g;
   char name[20];
} sEMP;
typedef union uemployee{
   int id;
   int sal;
   char g;
   char name[20];
} uEMP;
int main() {
    printf("size of structure:%d\n",sizeof(sEMP));
 
   printf("size of union:%d\n",sizeof(uEMP));
  
   sEMP es;
   uEMP eu;
   uEMP *eu1=NULL;
   eu.id=101;
   eu.sal=10000;
  strcpy(eu.name,"ramyabalivada");
  printf("%s\n",eu.name);
  eu1=(uEMP*)(malloc(sizeof(uEMP)));
   eu1->id=103;
  printf("%d\n",eu1->id);
 
 
   return 0;
}
 
 
Output: size of structure:32
size of union:20
ramyabalivada
103
 
ENUM:
It a set of named integer constants specify all the legal values a variable of that type can have
Syntax:
  Enum enum-type-name{enumeration list} variable_list;
Enum always start with ‚Äò0‚Äô
                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Enomem is same as a enum
 
File handling:
A collection of logically related information.
It is permanent
There are start of the file and end of the file indicator
Floppy disk(permanent storage)
If you give the command cat it is in ram and it checks the files and takes the address using file pointer
FILE is structure it contains file pointers
Eg: an employee file with employee names,designation,salary
Two types:
Sequential file :all files are in particular order
Random access file: all files are in random access
In c ,in file you  can write anywhere
This structure to which the file pointer point to is of type FILE defined in the header file <stdio.h>
The only declaration needed for a file pointer is exemplified by:
FILE*fp;
FILE *fopen(char*name,char*mode);
fp=fopen(‚Äúfile name‚Äù,‚Äùmode‚Äù);
modes ü°™read only,writeonly,read write,append(add at the end of the file)
  The fopen() function opens the file whose name is the string pointed to by pathname and associates a stream with it.
    The argument mode points to a string beginning with one of the  following sequences (possibly followed by additional characters, as described       below):
  r   ü°∫   Open text file for reading.  The stream is  positioned  at  the beginning of the file.
 
   r+  ü°∫   Open for  reading and writing.  The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.
       w   ü°∫  Truncate file to zero length or create text  file  for writing. The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.
       w+ ü°∫   Open for  reading  and writing. The file is created if it doesnot exist, otherwise it is truncated.  The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.
       a   ü°∫  Open for appending (writing at end of file). The file is created if it does not exist.  The stream is positioned at the end of the file.
       a+ ü°∫   Open for reading  and appending (writing at end of file).  The file is created if it does not exist.  The initial file position for  reading is  at  the beginning  of the file, but output is always appended to the end of the file.
rb,wbü°∫ binary read,binary write
once the function fopen() returns a FILE type pointer stored in a pointer of type FILE,this pointer becomes the medium through which all subsequent i/o can be performed
while trying to open the file if the file returns the address then it means file is present if it returns null it means file is not exist.
fseek is used to traverse the file
fclose ü°∫ int fclose(FILE *stream);
fprintf,fscanfü°∫ formatted writing,reading respectively
fputs,fgetsü°∫ unformatted i/o operations
fwrite/freadü°∫ reading or writing binary objects(whole structure or content)


char *fgets(char *s, int size, FILE *stream);
  int fputc(int c, FILE *stream);
 
    int fputs(const char *s, FILE *stream);
 
fgetc() reads the next character from stream and returns it  as  an unsigned char cast to an int, or EOF on end of file or error.
 
int fgetc(FILE *stream);
ctrl+c is used to stop the stream
 
for reading:
 
char ch;
while((ch)=fgetc(fd)!=EOF)
{
    Fputc(ch,fd)
}
question: read the contents from the database the record of the employees
101|amit kumar| M| 8888|100001
101|amit kumar| M| 8888|100002
101|amit kumar| M| 8888|100001
Read the content from the file store in the structure and display the structure using fgets(it gives new line at the end so we use the null at the end)
And also give the value according to the number of records in memory allocation
 
                      System programming
In system we cannot the execute certain linux commands
Execl , excelp is used to execute a file
Fseek-tells the position of the cursor in integer(or after which byte your pointer is positioned)
The ftell() function in C is used to determine the current position of the file pointer within a file. It returns the position as a long integer, which represents the number of bytes from the beginning of the file.
fseek () - It is used to moves the reading control to different positions using fseek function. ftell () - It tells the byte location of current position in file pointer. rewind () - It moves the control to beginning of a file.
Fseek:
   Int fseek(file *stream,long offset,int whence);
  SEEK_SET,SEEK_CUR,SEEK_END in whence
Here the offset become ‚Äò0‚Äô
Fseek(fp,0,SEEK_END);ü°∫to know how many number of bytes in that particular file.
Fseek(fp,-12,SEEK_cur); ü°∫ we can write the offset value negative and positive values
Rewind:
(Void) fseek(stream,0L,SEEK_SET);
Errors is einval  ü°∫ EINVAL The whence argument to fseek() was not SEEK_SET, SEEK_END, or  SEEK_CUR.  Or: the resulting file offset would be negative.
Fread
reading or giving the contents to ptr
size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);
The  function fread()  reads  nmemb items of data, each size bytes long, from the stream pointed to by  stream, storing  them  at  the location given by ptr.
Read the Data from file to pointer
Fwrite:
Write the contents from the ptr
size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb,                     FILE *stream);
write the data from pointer to file
In printf and scanf we write and read the text but  in fread and fwrite it gives the binary values
On  success, fread() and fwrite() return the number of items read or
written.  This number equals the number of  bytes  transferred only when  size  is 1.   If  an error occurs, or the end of the file is reached, the return value is a short item count (or zero).fread() does not distinguish  between end-of-file  and  error, and callers must use feof(3) and ferror(3) to determine which occurred.
